<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

In this project, I copied the style and layout of the Newsweek site &lt;<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/">View Source</a>&gt; also I use google fonts because in the newsweek site they use Roboto, Arial, Helvetica. Finally I use Boostrap for learning purpouses.
<br>

Project created using HTML and CSS3 and Boostrap Framework in the Version 4.4.1.
<br>
